<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control panel (generally situated in the entryway hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been activated, wise alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have actually been set off, instead of getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours).
