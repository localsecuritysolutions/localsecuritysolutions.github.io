We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false alerts). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have been activated.

I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
