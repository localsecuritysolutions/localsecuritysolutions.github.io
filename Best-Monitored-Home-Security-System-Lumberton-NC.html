We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is developed by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect notifies). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.
