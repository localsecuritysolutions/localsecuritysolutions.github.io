<p>The Blue by ADT Outdoor Camera is an operate in progress. We've seen enhancements during our short time with the battery-operated camera, however we simply can't recommend a $200 camera that does not offer the ability to zoom video and will not have the ability to hold up against outdoor temperature levels below 14 degrees Fahrenheit.
