<p>Expenses for systems differ. Bigger systems that provide full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most costly alternatives. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive option. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's taking place on the other end. And while this is a quite basic function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>Constructed with a compact style and a long variety WiFi antenna, the cameras can be put virtually anywhere. Plug in your cameras to a nearby source of power and set them up near your entranceways inside or outside to monitor what is occurring around the day, night or house. La Vigne, Nancy G., Samantha S. Lowry, Joshua A. Markman, Allison M. Dwyer. 2011. Examining the Use of Public Surveillance Cameras for Criminal Offense Control and Avoidance.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
