As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store.

It also implies that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly tape-record a message to him or her through your smartphone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you imagine, would be enough to send out even the most dedicated career criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
