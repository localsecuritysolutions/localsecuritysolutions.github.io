The majority of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow response times.</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems typically don't included upfront fees. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way approximately 5-year contracts!
