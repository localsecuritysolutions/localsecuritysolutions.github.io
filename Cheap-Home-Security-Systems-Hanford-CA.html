The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the porch by a certified electrician (who occurs to be my husband). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered the camera controls, I was reasonably satisfied. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the individual being viewed know they're being viewed, and you can pick to tape video or pictures and save them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
