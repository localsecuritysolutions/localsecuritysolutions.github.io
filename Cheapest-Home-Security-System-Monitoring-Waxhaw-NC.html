<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Asset protection devices are developed to safeguard specific, tangible assets, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and family treasures. These devices can be equipped with anti-tampering innovation to prevent being disarmed.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensors, are different in that they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
