<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
