We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
