<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
