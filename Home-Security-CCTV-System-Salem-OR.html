<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
