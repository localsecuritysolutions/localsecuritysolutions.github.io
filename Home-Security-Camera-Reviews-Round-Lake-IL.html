<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas.
