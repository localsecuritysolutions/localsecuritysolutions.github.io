<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
