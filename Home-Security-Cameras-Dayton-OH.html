<p>One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 monthly, which could be an inexpensive choice for clients in backwoods. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 per month, however you'll pay a bit more if you want to add additional functions, like a security camera. While a typical agreement runs 42 months (among the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is just for users who wish to rent their equipment. Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>

But for normal applications, connection concerns are controlled by normal supervision messages, sent out daily or weekly. </p>
