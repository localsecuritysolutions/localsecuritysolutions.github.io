<p>I explained that all we would need to do is use any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, might merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
