<h3>Home Alarm System Monitoring Olive Branch MS 38654</h3>
<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are slightly more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are onerous, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, but you'll pay a bit more if you wish to add extra functions, like a security camera. While a common contract runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to lease their equipment. Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
