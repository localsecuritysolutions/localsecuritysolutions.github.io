However, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have essential fobs and additional sensing units, too.</p>
