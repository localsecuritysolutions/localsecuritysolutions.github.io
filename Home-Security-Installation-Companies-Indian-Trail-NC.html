<p>While you need to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it is among the more cost effective subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month. This is a costly security camera, but we think it deserves the financial investment. Increasing release of voice over IP technology (VoIP) is driving the adoption of broadband signaling for alarm reporting. Many websites requiring alarm installations no longer have traditional telephone lines (POTS), and alarm panels with traditional telephone dialer ability do not work reliably over some kinds of VoIP service.</p>
