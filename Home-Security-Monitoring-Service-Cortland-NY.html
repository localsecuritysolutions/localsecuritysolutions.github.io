<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera separately, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
