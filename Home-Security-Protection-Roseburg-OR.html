When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that details when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION).
