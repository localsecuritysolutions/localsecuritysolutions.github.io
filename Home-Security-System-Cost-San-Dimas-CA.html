Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the danger and, if required, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>

<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same method as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is watching you'?
