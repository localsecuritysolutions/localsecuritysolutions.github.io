DIY-installed systems like Frontpoint, SimpliSafe, and Ring send you the equipment to set up, conserving you some money. With years of experience installing and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle services and homes, we have actually developed fantastic relationships with both local police forces and their customers.</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, usage equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, included long and generally onerous agreements, and typically rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated individually and don't advise for many people.</p>

<p>The price of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, because it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds costly, however it's not a lot when you consider that a live human is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras identify suspicious activity. That individual at Deep Guard's facility can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everybody, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
