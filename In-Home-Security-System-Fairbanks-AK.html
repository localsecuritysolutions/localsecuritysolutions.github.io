<h3>Home Alarm Installation in Fairbanks AK</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control panel (generally located in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensors have actually been activated, smart alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensors have been triggered, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially bothersome your neighbours).
