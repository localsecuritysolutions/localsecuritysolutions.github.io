Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
