<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).
