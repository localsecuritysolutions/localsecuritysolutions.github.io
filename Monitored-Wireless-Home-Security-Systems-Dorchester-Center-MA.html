The app is hugely excellent, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensor in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>Our doorbell camera instantly discovers packages and utilizes light and sound to actively deter bundle burglars. With two-way talk, it also lets you answer the door from anywhere. And the app provides you fast access to your locks and garage door so you can let in the good and stay out the bad. I can speak to the Camera end and hear whatever in genuine time.

PIR sensing units identify motion and ought to be placed in a corridor or other rooms that have an entry point to your home. Once again, if the alarm is equipped and the sensing unit detects motion, the siren will sound.</p>
