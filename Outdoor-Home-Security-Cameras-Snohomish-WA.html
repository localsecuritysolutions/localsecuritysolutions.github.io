But suicide attackers are clearly not hindered by camera - and might even be drawn in to the tv coverage cameras can guarantee - and the cost of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget - far exceeds the limited benefits that the system might provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off.
