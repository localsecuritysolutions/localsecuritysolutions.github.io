<p>Primarily, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the rate.

When you're feeling old-fashioned, you can control Vivint security with a keychain remote, the primary control or a mobile app panel.</p>
