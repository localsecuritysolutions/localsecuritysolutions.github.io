On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't include a ton of other wise home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of clever home equipment from other companies.
