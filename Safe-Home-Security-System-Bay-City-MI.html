We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
