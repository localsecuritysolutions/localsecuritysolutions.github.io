If you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the costs. It ships with four white and sleek bullet-style cameras designed for indoor and outdoor use. They're equipped with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and smart IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our testing that the app sometimes forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
