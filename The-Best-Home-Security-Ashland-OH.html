<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All objects produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy produced by a things is known as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter a things is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that can finding tiny differences in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon details about the temperature distinctions.
