<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

<p>A taut wire border security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
