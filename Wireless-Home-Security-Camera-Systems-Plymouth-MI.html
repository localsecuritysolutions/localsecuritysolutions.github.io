<p>Our alarm systems might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge an offense. As soon as a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. When the signal is received, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped.
